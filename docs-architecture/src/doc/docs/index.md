## Project Naming

Project names should use colors, e.g. from 
[Digital Synopsis Color Thesaurus](https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/color-thesaurus-correct-names-of-shades/)

Projects should pick a color from the appropriate layer. Currently defined layers are

* Grey: core components, API, etc
* Brown: build tools, deployment scripts, etc
